## Install and uninstall
* To install, go to the releases (https://github.com/cooolgamer/3DS-custom-keyboard/releases) then download the "Coool Custom Keyboard (your region).cia" file and install it with FBI!
* To uninstall, go to the releases then download the "Original Keyboard (your region).cia" file and, again, install it with FBI, it will restore original keyboard.

## Warning: the keyboard isn't signed, meaning you SHOULD NOT uninstall your custom firmware. If you want to, simply install the original keyboard.
